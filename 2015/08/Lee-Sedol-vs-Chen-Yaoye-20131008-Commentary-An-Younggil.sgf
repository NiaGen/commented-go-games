Lee Sedol 9p and Chen Yaoye 9p played together recently in the final of 9th Chunlan Cup, as well as in the group stage of this tournament. Chen won both those games, so this was a revenge match for Lee.

After Chen won the 9th Chunlan Cup in June, many Go fans regard Chen as the #1 in the world. It's because Chen defeated Lee Sedol in the final. The deciding game of the final was the masterpiece. You'll see the both players' spirit, power and the profound reading through the whole game. 
http://gogameguru.com/go-commentary-chen-yaoye-vs-lee-sedol-9th-chunlan-cup-final/

Lee Sedol was in deep slump in the 1st half of 2013, but he's recovered from the slump, and  he's in good form these days. Many of his fans still consider him as the top of the world. 

Their head to head records so far is tie with 5-5. However, Chen's winning last three games in a row, so this would be a hard game for Lee. 

When this game was played, Lee was ranked #3 in Korea, and Chen was #1 in China. 

Let's have a look at their dynamic games. ]RE[B+0.50]

;W[en]LB[pi:A][gp:C][jp:B]C[Black won by 0.5 point. 

Lee Sedol won the revenge match, and proceeded to the quarter finals.

The opening was playable for both, and the game had been even in the middle game. There were big trades in the top right corner, but the game was still in balanced after the big fighting. White was slightly behind after a combat on the left side, but he revered the game by A, and kept leading the game afterwards. Hane at B was Lee's last hope, and made the game very complicated. After that, Chen's small mistake at C costed the game unfortunately.  

It was a very important match by Lee Sedol. He was in the losing streask against Chen, but he can rebound from winning this game. Lee was behind at the endgame stage, but he didn't give up. His spirit was great, and eventually reversed the game. 

Meanwhile, it would be a regretful game by Chen Yaoye. He showed the amazing move at A when everybody thought he was in emergency, and the reversed the game. Chen hardly loses his games in the endgame, but he couldn't save his leading until the very end. 

The game was very interesting and exciting to watch, because Lee and Chen's moves were beautiful and profound. I'll be very happy if you can feel the both players' thoughts and plans a bit more with this commentary. 

 If you have any questions or opinions, please feel free to leave a comment.
