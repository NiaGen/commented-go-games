PW[Gu Li]PB[Mi Yuting]WR[9p]BR[4p]DT[2013-12-2]EV[MLily Cup ]RO[Final, Game 2]SO[gogameguru.com]C[This is game 2 from the 1st MLily Cup final played between Gu Li 9p and Mi Yuting 4p. 

The game was played on December 2, 2013, in China.

Gu won game 1 of the final, and if Gu wins this game again, it'll be an easy series for him. 

Gu Li was ranked #3 in China by the time this game was played, and he was still one of the most popular players along with Lee Sedol 9p in the world. 

Gu's already won seven international titles in his career, but the last time was 2010.

His style of play is active and creative. He's very good at opening, and his haengma is sharp and strong. His games are always dynamic and thrilling, and that's the main reason why people like his games so much. 

Gu defeated Na Hyun 3p, Hu Yaoyu 9p, Wang Lei 6p, and Zhou Ruiyang 9p (2-0 in the semifinal) respectively to the final. 


Mi Yuting was born in 1996, and he became a pro in 2007. He was ranked #7 in China, but he was still unknown internationally by that time. 

His best result in the international tournaments before this MLily Cup was round of 16. However, his performance in this tournament was very impressive. 

He defeated Lee Sedol 9p, Kang Dongyun 9p, Kong Jie 9p, Dang Yifei 4p and Wang Xi 9p (2-1 in the semifinal) to reach the final.

He was relatively unknown, but his reading was already propound and accurate, and he's also got strong mind even if he was only 17 year old boy.

The time limit for this final is 3 hours with 1 min x 5 times each. 
The winner's prize is 1,800,000 RMB (US$ 300,000approx), and 600,000 RMB for the runner-up.

A and B are miai for black to live, and white's far behind now.  

Mi Yuting won the game 2, and the series had become a tie with 1-1. 

The game started with a new variation. C was unusual, and D was a bit questionable. E wasn't good, and the result up to F was even. Black had a better result up to G, but H was Gu Li's brilliant move, and the game became even again. I was a mistake, and when black lived on the left side, black took the lead of the game. White tried very hard to catch up after that, but J was the finishing blow, and Mi Yuting didn't give white any chances until the end of the game. 

Mi Yuting showed his strongness at the close combat, especially on the left hand side. Gu Li tried very hard to make the game complicated through the whole game, but Mi didn't make any mistakes against Gu Li's tricky moves, and clearly finished the game. 

On the other hand, it wasn't very impressive game by Gu Li. The game was his style, but he didn't show the power and sharpness against a new teenage challenger. Normally, his opponents easily get trapped against his tricky probes like 1-4. However, Mi still kept his calmness, and Gu couldn't grasp any good chance to win. 

I hope that you'll understand and enjoy this exciting game more with the commentary, and please feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions or opinions about the game.

Thanks,
