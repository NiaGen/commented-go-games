White was winning about 10 point on the board, so Black didn't continue, but resigned.

Unbelievely AlphaGo defeated Fan Hui 2p again, and the match was finished by 5-0.

The opening up to White 34 was even, but Black 35 to 37 was questionable, and White started to be ahead by 52.

Black 57 and 65 were mistakes, and White took the lead. 

White 70 and 74 were wrong, but Black 75 missed out a great chance to catch up.

White 80 was an overplay, but Black 93 was premature, and that was regarded as the losing move.

White took the clear lead with 94, and White didn't give Black any chances to catch up.

White's second half of the game was excellent, and I couldn't find any serious mistakes from White.

The style of Alphago seems to be slightly territorial, but well balanced. It's good at haengma and tesuji, but its playing isn't yet perfect. 

As we can see, it made several questionable moves and mistakes, but the second half was much more accurate and refined than the first half.

The games of AlphaGo in this match were very impressive, and I never expected that a computer Go program can play this strong and smooth moves.

That's so surprising and shocking, and I look forward to watching the match between Lee Sedol 9p and AlphaGo in March 2016.

I hope you will understand and enjoy watching this historical game more with this commentary, and if you have any questions or opinions, please feel free to leave a comment.

Thanks,
