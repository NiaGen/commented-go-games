AlphaGo seems to be fond of two star formation, and that's because it's flexible and well balanced.

Creating a Chinese style opening with A or B is usual, but Lee played on the right side with 7.

Black 7 seemed as if Lee wanted to test AlphaGo's opening sense, but it wasn't a good choice as a result.]

White 58 was to make its own stones solid and stronger by sacrificing the attachment. 

That's a high level tactic, and AlphaGo chose that move because White was in the good mood.

Because of those reasons, pros were surprised by AlphaGo's accurate estimate and flexible tactic.

By the way, Black 61 was a bit questionable, and it should have extended at A instead.

Black 77 doesn't look urgent, but it seems as if Lee was also confident of the game at this stage. He didn't expect that AlphaGo's endgame and counting is so accurate and excellent at the time in game 1.
 
Both White 78 and Black 79 were big approaches, but White 80 was unexpected.

I was told that AlphaGo calculated and it thought the game was good enough for White, but I don't think that was the best move in this situation.

Black was ahead only by 1 or 2 points on the board, so he can't pay the komi.

AlphaGo won the first game of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, that must have been the most sensational and shocking moment of Go.

AlphaGo showed its good sense and the accurate reading ability along with its perfect endgame and the estimate skill.

Lee had a good chance in the middle game, but he missed out to peep at A, and White's unexpected invasion at B (White 102) showed AlphaGo's power and strength.

Even if Lee lost this first game, he wasn't disappointed that much.

That's because he played some moves to test to feel how strong the AlphaGo is, and he was still confident in the best five match. 

However, he was getting realized in the following games that AlphaGo didn't show its full power in this very first game either.

I hope you will enjoy watching this game more with this commentary, and if you have any questions or concerns about the game, please feel free to leave a comment.
